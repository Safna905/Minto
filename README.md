# minto_app

A restaurant order taking Project

## Getting Started


- A new flutter app to design and develop an order taking app which will be used at restaurants.

1. Name of the app: MINTO
2. Need to come up with an app icon for this name.
3. There should be a splash screen showing the app name (or a logo).
4. There should be a login screen.
5. After logging in, the user should be taken to a table selection screen, which will list all the tables in the restaurant ( there should be some indication classifying the open and occupied tables).
6. User should select an open table and should be able to take the orders from the list of available menu.
